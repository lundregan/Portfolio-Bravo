## What is No-Code?

No-Code is the movement of using software to create software without writing any code. To create and deploy production ready application without touching a single line of code.

If you are a **designer**, **buissness owner**, **starving artist**, or what have you...

It is a thing of beauty to be able to drag and drop components, to change one or two properties here and there to create a product that helps you **aquire new clients**, **increase brand awareness**, or **run an online store**.

Thats without ever writing a single line of code, which means you don't need to hire a developer or spend a large investment of time into a skill which you only need/want to produce one product with.

### What about Developers?

I have spoken about how nocode can benefit non-developers, but what about dveelopers who know how to code?

Well I believe as nocode tools become more advanced their use with developers will increase.

You can put together an application quickly using a nocode tool, decreasing time spent working on the simple very reapeatable things.
Which frees up your time to spend developing more advanced features that the nocode tool may not be equiped to handle.

If you work on similiar projects you can set up templates, which can be tweaked to suit the needs of the current project. You can already do this, but being able to mouse over and drag items around as needed can save time looking through code which can become complex on larger applications.
