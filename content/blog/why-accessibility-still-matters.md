# What Do I Mean By Accessibility?

*Accessibility - The ability to access*

Related to web development, this means the users ability to access your website, app, resource, material, or data.
It is not only important for people with disabilities who may not be able to access a website like other users, but is also important for people with other accessability concerns for example; **slow internet connections**, or using a  **mobile device**, ...

The web was founded on interconnectivity, connecting people and resources together to form a 'Web' hence the terms 'World Wide Web' and 'Website'

## Why have an accessible website?

Lets start with a hypothetical...

You are a quite established developer and run a company who create software solotuions focusing on the web for big name clients.
Now so far you have done quite well for yourself, you have created solutions for a few big companies in your area and have your own website advertising your services.

Meanwhile a man named **Rich Richman**, who runs a huge compnay bringing in billions a year is looking to outsource his web development and get a new product to hit the ground within the next year.

Now **Mr Richman** wasn't the most gifted child, he suffers from color-blindness, he has also focused most of his life on buissness connections, meetings and the real blood sweat and tears that go into building and running companies, his technical aptitude is lacking somewhat.

**Mr Richman** gets a two suggestions for companies to go with to build out his new project, yours and another company we'll name **Accesible Website Inc**.

**Mr Richman** being the diligent man that he is, goes to research both websites. He goes on to your website, well he thinks its a website anyway since he cant find any links at the top just a single colored bar, he spends 20-30 minutes trouble shooting getting his assistant to help where finally he can see the text enough to read.

Then **Mr Richman** tries to vist a different section, and it takes forever to load... Now this is probably the fault of **Mr Richman** having a very slow connection as he doesnt use the web too much, and the old computer running old software that he has kept hold of as a souvernierr.

**Mr Richman** spends some time looking through the website, finding it quite difficult to reach the information he is after. Some of the links are buried behind multiple other links, that arn'tm quite intuitive.

**Mr Richman** after spending about an hour, decides to look at the other company. "wholly smoke" he gasps in surprise.

**Mr Richamn** finds that the website built by **accessible Website Inc** loads much faster than the other, and whats more is that he can already read most things on the website.

**Mr Richman** only spends 10-15 minutes on this website before being finshed, finding it quite easy to find the information he was looking for.


So which company do you think **Rich Richman** is going to contact and hire to fill his needs, building a valube connection for years to come?

If I was a betting man, then it would hands down be **Accessible Website Inc**

Being accessible means that clients, or users are able to use your website. If someone can't use your website, then it doesn't matter what you offer, or sell. They are very unlikely to become, or continue to be a client/customer/user.

This doesnt just apply to very rare rich people who are in a very specific circumstance. No this applies to every time someone goes on your website to **buy shoes**, **subscribe to a newsletter**, **find legal advice**, or anyhting else. This doesnt even apply to that one person but every single person they know, if dont make a website accessible for one person then its not accessible for many others and it is unlikely to be rocommmened, written, or talked about by them.


## Some Suggestions on how We Can Increase Accessability
